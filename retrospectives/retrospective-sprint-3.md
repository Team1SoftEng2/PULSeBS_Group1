RETROSPECTIVE 3 (Team 1)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs done: 7 - 7 
- Total points committed vs done: 34 - 34
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team): 60 - 61,5

**Remember**  a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |    7    |   -    |   33h42    |   31h57      |
| _#1_   |    2    |   5    |   1h30     |   1h30       |
| _#2_   |    2    |   5    |   3h       |   3h45       |
| _#3_   |    1    |   3    |   1h       |   1h         |
| _#4_   |    3    |   5    |   3h30     |   5h         |
| _#6_   |    2    |   8    |   7h       |   7h         |
| _#8_   |    2    |   5    |   45m      |   45m        |
| _#9_   |    4    |   3    |   10h30    |   10h45      |   

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation): average 2h 56m, standard deviation 2h 41m

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent from previous table: 0.98
  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated:  17h
  - Total hours spent: 17h 40m
  - Nr of automated unit test cases:  
  - Coverage (if available): 59.9%
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 4h30 
  - Total hours spent: 4h30
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 2h
  - Total hours spent: 2h
- Technical Debt management:
  - Total hours estimated: 30m 
  - Total hours spent: 12m
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube: 30m
  - Hours spent on remediation: 12m 
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability"): 0.1%
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability ):

  Reliability -> A
  
  Security -> A
  
  Maintainability -> A

## ASSESSMENT 

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
The assessment of time to complete a number of tests necessary to fit the definition of done in older stories was difficult 
 
- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
Pair programming is a useful tool

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
More scrum meetings, pair programming sessions
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
We achieved all of the goals we set for this sprint

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
Mantain the standards and procedures that we established in this sprint, decide some rules to apply when working on the same code

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
We reached 60% of coverage
