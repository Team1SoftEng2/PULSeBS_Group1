RETROSPECTIVE 2 (Team 1)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs done: 7 - 2 
- Total points committed vs done: 37 - 11
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team): 72 - 60

**Remember**  a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD 

### Detailed statistics

| _#7_   |    4    |   8    |   8h       |   12h5       |   

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation): average 2h 13m, standard deviation 2h

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent from previous table: 1.06
  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated:  16h
  - Total hours spent: 13h
  - Nr of automated unit test cases:  8 for now
  - Coverage (if available): 19.6%
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 4h 
  - Total hours spent: 4h20
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 2h
  - Total hours spent: 2h
- Technical Debt management:
  - Total hours estimated: 30m 
  - Total hours spent: 5m
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube: 30m
  - Hours spent on remediation: 5m 
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability"): 0.0%
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability ):

  Reliability -> A
  
  Security -> A
  
  Maintainability -> A

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
A team member was not able to complete any of his tasks 
 
- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
Testing is quite tricky but it leads to a better understanding of your code

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  More uniform amount of hours beteween team members, completion of self-assigned tasks
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
Scrum meetings with all the members because of conflicting schedules

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
More scrum meetings, pair programming sessions

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
Better team work and independent work
