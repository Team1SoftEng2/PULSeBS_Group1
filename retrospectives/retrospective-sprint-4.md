RETROSPECTIVE 3 (Team 1)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs done: 4 - 4 
- Total points committed vs done: 60 - 60 
- Nr of hours planned vs spent (as a team): 60 - 68

**Remember**  a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |    9    |   -    |  18h10     |   17h10      |
| _#10_  |    4    |   13   |   8h30     |   8h35       |
| _#11_  |    5    |   21   |   10h30    |   15h45      |
| _#12_  |    4    |   21   |   12h30    |   18h        |
| _#13_  |    4    |   5    |   10h      |   8h30       |  

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation): average 2h 36m, standard deviation 2h 12m

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent from previous table: 0.88
  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 15h25
  - Total hours spent: 18h
  - Nr of automated unit test cases:  
  - Coverage (if available): 55.03%
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 
  - Total hours spent: 
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated: 1h
  - Total hours spent: 45m
- Technical Debt management:
  - Total hours estimated: 30m
  - Total hours spent: 32m
  - Hours estimated for remediation by SonarQube: 4h 2m
  - Hours spent on remediation: 32m 
  - debt ratio (as reported by SonarQube under "Measures-Maintainability"): 0%
  - rating for each quality characteristic reported in SonarQube under "Measures" (namely reliability, security, maintainability ):

  Reliability -> A
  
  Security -> A
  
  Maintainability -> A

## ASSESSMENT 

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

Some tasks were more complex than anticipated or required the use of new libraries that we had to learn. 
 
- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

We understood the amount of stories that we can take in a sprint to be sure to complete them all; we also managed to work as a team while fixing big issues.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?

Maintain standards and procedures acquired in the last sprint as much as possible.
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

We did not decide some rules to apply when working on the same code because we all worked on different stories, so they were not needed.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

Pass the exam!

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

We showed consistent impovements which was recognized even by the professor.
